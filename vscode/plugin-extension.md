# To see extension logs in VS Code, you can follow these steps:

Open the Command Palette: Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS).

Run the "Developer: Toggle Developer Tools" command: Type "Developer: Toggle Developer Tools" in the Command Palette and select it. This will open the Chrome DevTools.

Go to the "Console" tab: In the DevTools window, click on the "Console" tab.

Look for extension logs: Extension logs will typically be prefixed with the extension's name or identifier. You can also filter the logs by typing the extension's name in the filter bar.

Note: Some extensions may have their own logging settings or output logs to a different location. Refer to the extension's documentation for specific instructions on viewing its logs.
